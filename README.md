## Pokemon Challenge: A Simple Pokemon Game Application  ##
Technologies Used: React, NodeJS, ReactStrap, PostgreSQL

## Introduction:
Pokemon Challenge is a simple Pokemon inspired game application. This application is a simple, one page React application crafted using React for the front end, NodeJS and PostgreSQL for the backend, ReactStrap for styling, and PostgreSQL database.

## Overview:
Pokemon Challenge is designed as a single-page game app that incorporates elements from the Pokemon universe through data sourced from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/). The primary objective is to create an entertaining experience where players can build their personalized Pokedex by "catching" Pokemon monsters by selecting the correct type of the Pokemon. 

## Audience:
The intended audience for this game app is a wide range of gmae players. 
## Features:

**User Authentication:**
Players will have the ability to sign up and log in to the app.
User data, including username, and password will be securely stored in a PostgreSQL database.

**Pokedex Building:**
Players will draw Pokemon cards, each featuring a challenge for the player to identify the type of the drawn Pokemon.
Players 'catch' the Pokemon by correctly choosing the monsters' type; adding the card to their 'Pokedex' of won cards.

**Score Tracking:**
A scorecard will be displayed to track the number of cards won.
The PostgreSQL database stores player information, including the Pokemon they've won.

**Pokedex Organization:**
The won cards in the Pokedex are categorized by type, enhancing the user experience.
Players can click on a card to flip it over, revealing character properties such as name, type, and abilities.
